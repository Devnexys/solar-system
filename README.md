## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Black screen or no planets visible**
- Check browser console for WebGL errors
- Ensure WebGL is enabled in browser
- Try refreshing the page

**Poor performance on mobile**
- Reduce star count in `createStarField()`
- Lower planet geometry detail
- Disable shadows for better performance

**Controls not responding**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
